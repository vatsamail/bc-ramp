### Fundamentals of Block Chain development
### Technologies: Ethereum, Dapps, Python, Solidity, DAO, DeFi, Polygon, Chainlink, Metamask

### Features:
* Decentralized - n/w of independent users
* Transparent - no back door deals
* Speed - seconds to minutes
* Immutable, so secured
* Remove brand based agreement to 
* Trust minimized agreement
* Hybrid smart contracts - chainlink
* Decentralized Autonomous organization

* Hybrid smart contracts - Chainlink ( a powerful blockchain oracle)

## Setup


### Jargons
* Consensus: agreement the state of the block chain. Example: Nakomoto concensus
* Proof of work (algo for blockchain riddle). Cause a lot of electricity for mining.
* Gas or transaction fee
* Proof of stake : paid to validator (not miners). Puts a stake and then when it misbehaves it loses the money. Example: Pocodock, pockodot, antera - eth-2.0 upgrades. It is faster and gives sybil attack protection. But the cons, it is slightly less decentralized.
* Randomness: ETH-2.0 for selection of nodes.
* Block reward : cuts in 1/2 once every 4 years for bitcoin. miners currently get block reward + transaction fee. Eventually just transaction fee
* Attacks: 1. sybil attack: one node when it fakes to be multiple machine to create multiple collaterals and 2. 51% attack: to influence the network. ETH-classic had this issue.
* Sharding: is a solution that is blockchain of blockchain and solves scalability problem.
* Layer #1 : Base layer solution example: eth, bitcoin etc. 
* Layer #2: Chainlink, orbitron, optimism and has rollups.
* rollup and sidechain: rollup derives the hash security from base but sidechain will have its own.
